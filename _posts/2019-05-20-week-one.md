Having successfully completed Code Platoon, I am now completing my second week at [8th Light][8L-website]{:target="_blank"}!   

I've been tasked with learning my first strongly typed language - C#.  After getting the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro){:target="_blank"} installed to use with Visual Studio Code, and completing a quick "Hello World",  I started working through some Koans to introduce me to the language.  Koans are essentially a set of simple problems where you are asked to “fill in the blanks”. They look a lot like unit tests, and present a lot of prewritten code. 

I followed [Bobby Johnson][BJohnson]'s repo which you can check out [here][Koans]{:target="_blank"}.  He also wrote [a short article](http://iamnotmyself.com/2016/07/22/learn-c-on-windows-osx-or-linux-with-the-net-core-koans-2/){:target="_blank"} explaining how he came to love koans, and why he created a set for .NET/C#. Bobby's koans introduced me to [xUnit][xUnit]{:target="_blank"} - one of C#'s testing suites and encouraged a TDD style of thinking.  I found the Koans very helpful - they highlighted the small differences between languages I already know and prompted me to research areas that were completely new to me!

This week I have been working on a Coin Changer Kata. The basic premise is: 

*Produce the minimal amount of change for a given amount. For instance, If the input is: 99 cents of a dollar, the output should be: 3 quarters, 2 dimes, and 4 pennies The output can be something as simple as 25, 25, 25, 10, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1 which is the same as 99 cents.*


I'm currently reading **Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design** by *Corey Haines*.  I tried to approach Kata with the 4 rules in mind.  Initially practicing TDD - building each test and then making it pass, until I had something that satisfied the requirements, albeit rather ugly.  I then refactored, modifing the data structures whilst considering how the end user may want to obtain data.  I tried to not be afraid to delete code. I went through 5 revisions, playing around with different ways of calculating the correct coins and how they are stored/returned.  [View my code here](https://github.com/wynspeare/CSharp-Coin-Changer){:target="_blank"}.

Today I will be reviewing my code with my mentor and getting feedback on what I have been working on!
